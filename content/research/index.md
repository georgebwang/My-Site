I am currently undertaking pre-doctoral finance research training. Once available, drafts of my working papers will be displayed on this page. 

Currently, my research interests lie in the area of fixed-income markets. I am particularly interested in both the asset pricing and corporate financing implications of flows and trading by fixed-income funds.
