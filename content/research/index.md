My apologies for the blank page -- I am currently still undertaking finance research training at the Honours/PhD first-year level.

My research interests lie broadly in the areas of Empirical Asset Pricing, Institutional Investors, and Empirical Market Microstructure. I am on my random walk (hopefully with some drift :smiley:) exploring my specific research topics. Currently I am particularly interested in options, corporate bonds, and institutional investors.
