In this post I'd like to share some of the desktop apps that I use on a daily basis. 

Note that I'm now actually a Linux user. Even though I had been using Windows
since I was a child , I decided to jump into the Linux world as soon as I started my MCom journey of academic research in Finance.

My main reasons for choosing Linux:
* The GNOME desktop environment looks beautiful to me
* The native Unix command-line interface is great (I especially like the package management tools)
* Almost all the apps I need are available on Linux
* Updates of software packages (e.g., R packages) are usually firstly made available on Linux

There are many 'flavours' or 'distributions' of Linux that users can choose from, I personally prefer
Ubuntu-based distros. I've used Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Pop!_OS, I eventually settled down with [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) -- I think it's the most elegant one and it also has an amazing workspace layout that boosts productivity.

Below I'll list some utility apps that 
I frequently use in my everyday research studies. These apps should be available across all platforms (Windows, MacOS or Linux).

### Visual Studio Code

I think [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the best (and also free) IDE for Python, especially because it supports native Jupyter notebook editing -- I don't have to open up a browser to use
Jupyter when I have VSCode with me. Its Jupyter engine supports Julia as well, though I haven't had the time to learn this relatively new language (Julia is a great language & I'm definitely gonna learn it in the near future). I write LaTeX in VScode too, it has an awesome extension (i.e., LaTeX Workshop) that makes typesetting in LaTeX very easy. There are many other extensions available in VSCode, and with them one can accomplish so many tasks at ease.

### GitKraken

Version control is very important when writing codes or typesetting in LaTeX in my opinion, and I use GitHub (pretty much the most popular choice) for versioning my code. For an easier and more convenient experience with GitHub, I highly recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git. It's not entirely free though, but if you have a university email address (student email address is ok too) you can use it for free. If not, a free alternative that essentially does the same job is [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), I don't use it because it's only available on Windows and Mac, unfortunately.  

### Zotero

I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to manage and backup the papers I read. It is free and open-source, with many extensions available to enhance its functionality. Zotero makes it very easy to create references in a document, since the papers can be selected and exported as a BibTeX file to be easily integrated with LaTeX. I highly recommend using Zotero along with its web browser extension, which allows you to download papers from publisher websites in one or two clicks. Syncing files in Zotero is a bit more complicated if you're not willing to pay \$\$ for the official syncing service, and I'll probably write a new post to explain in detail how to sync files (for free) in Zotero across devices.

### Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a Markdown document editor with a powerful added feature of linking different Markdown files. This feature empowers the users to potentially build a mind map or a 'knowledge base', so it's very handy for making research or study notes. I take notes in Obsidian when I read papers or textbooks. I also integrate Obsidian with Zotero, in the sense that the Obsidian notes I've written for a particular paper can be directly linked to the paper entry in Zotero for improved accessibility. The official syncing functionality is a paid feature in Obsidian unfortunately, but there's an easy hack -- you can just put your Obsidian files and folders (called 'vaults' in Obsidian) in a Dropbox-synced folder, and let Dropbox do the syncing job. I use Dropbox to sync my notes and it works perfectly fine.

### OnlyOffice (for Linux users)

A huge drawback of Linux is that Linux doesn't support the Microsoft Office suite. MS Office is a commercial software so it's not a surprise that they don't appear on Linux. I had struggled to find an alternative office suite that has comparable functionality and usability to MS Office, until I found [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/). OnlyOffice supports the ordinary MS Office files (e.g., .docx, .xlsx and .pptx) flawlessly. Notably, its LaTeX support for equation insertion is comparable (or even better in my opinion) than MS Office, and it can be freely connected to a cloud for sync purposes. I link OnlyOffice to my [CloudStor](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services/cloudstor) cloud storage space so I have automatic backups of my files. Since we're here, I also highly recommend registering for CloudStor if you have an AUS/NZ university email address -- you can get 1TB cloud storage for free where you can easily sync/backup any local files to the cloud.

### CloudStor

[CloudStor](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services/cloudstor) provides the research and academic community with an easy-to-use collaboration workspace and integrated tools for sharing and analysing data. It's kind of like Dropbox in the sense that you can sync your local folders to the cloud and across devices. A really good thing about CloudStor is that it provides 1TB free cloud storage space for researchers at AARNet-connected institutions (essentially you get the 1TB as long as you have an AUS/NZ university email address, either staff or student is fine). I use CloudStor to backup and sync large datasets and also research papers in Zotero.

And that's it! I honestly think these apps have helped make my workflow more efficient, and I hope you've found some of them appealing to you as well. Try them out if you like!
