### Monash $\LaTeX$ Beamer Theme

I've written an unofficial Monash-themed $\LaTeX$ Beamer template, which can be found in its public  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/georgebwang/Beamer-MonashBS). I've prepared a main version and a cleaner version. Click the links to see example PDFs: <a href="main-example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Main</a>, <a href="cleaner-example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleaner</a>. Instructions for use are detailed on the GitHub repo page above. Enjoy!
