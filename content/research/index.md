I am currently undertaking pre-doctoral finance research training. Once available, drafts of research papers will be displayed on this page. 

My research interests lie broadly in the area of fixed-income markets. I am particularly interested in fixed-income mutual funds and ETFs, corporate debt profile, and corporate liquidity management.
