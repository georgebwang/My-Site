My apologies for the blank page -- I am currently still undertaking finance research training at the Honours/PhD first-year level.

My research interests lie broadly in the areas of Empirical Asset Pricing and Institutional Investors. I am particularly interested in the behaviour of investment companies (*e.g.,* mutual funds, ETFs) in fixed-income markets.
